  Prerequisite:
	Before replace system VMDK's.
	This is very important for furder operation, because both server have the same system VG names ( system).
	

	1.Change system volume group from system to suse11  
	./vg_name_change.sh system sles11
	2.Check if the name is successful rename.
	vgs
	PS: If VG names are different this action is not required.
	2.Unregister server from suse-manager.
	From suse-mgr01 execute ./register-to-SUSE-Manager.sh -e -s servername
	./register-to-SUSE-Manager.sh -e -l sles11to12
	3.Unjoined server from BASF domain.
	lxinfra01:/home/unxtools/ADJOIN/ADJOIN_LOCAL/basfad_join2AD.sh -u servername 
	4.Unregister server form APX:
	/opt/apxpccp/pccprel exec,DCM/DCM_DEREG_$(hostname).scp
	/opt/apxpccc/pccCrel exec,DCM/DCM_DEREG_$(hostname).scp
	5.Unregister server from HPSA.
	/opt/opsware/agent/bin/agent_uninstall.sh --no_deactivate --force
	

	 
	After VMDK replacement:
	

	All scripts and binary files are putted in /root/scripts/sles_migration/
	1.Go to a directory and execute:
	

	./sle11to12 old_vg new_vg hostname
	

	2.Go to a suse-mgr01 in directory /infra/linux/SuSE-manager and join server 
	./register-to-SUSE-Manager.sh -r -s sles11to12
	

	Inform colleagues from BASF to proceed with further action.
